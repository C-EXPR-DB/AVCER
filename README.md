## Abstract

In this article, the results of our team for the sixth ABAW Competition: CE Recognition Challenge are presented. We propose an audio-visual method for compound expression recognition. Our method is not based on training models of the target task, but it based on emotion recognition models that fuse modalities at the level of emotional probabilities, while decisions about predicting compound expressions are made based on rules. The proposed models are tested both as a result of multi-corpus training and as a result of cross-corpus validation. The results obtained show that the proposed method can potentially form the basis for the development of intelligent tools for annotating corpora in the context of basic and compound emotions.
